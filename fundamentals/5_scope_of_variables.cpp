    // Variable shadowing 
    // Consider that there is a local variable inside a function with the same name as that of a global variable. If the function tries to access the variable with that name, then which variable will be given precedence?

    // so let us first print the value of global_1 variable then again redlcare it and print it
    cout << "1. " << global_1 << endl;
    
    int  global_1 = 20;
    cout << "2. " << global_1 << endl;

    // Explanation: The variable a declared at the top is global variable and stores the value 5 whereas a declared within main function is local and stores a value 100. When accessed inside the main function, the local aâ€™s value is printed. Also, there is no compilation error. It implies that

    /**
        * If two variables with same name are defined in different scopes, the compiler allows it and does not show error.

        *Whenever there is a local variable defined with same name as that of a global variable, the precedence is given to the local variable. This is called variable shadowing.

    // but us want the actual value of global variable so we can do it using `::` ~ known as scope resolution operator
    cout << "3. " << ::global_1 << endl;
