#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "This is standard output (cout)." << endl;

    cerr << "This is an error message using cerr (un-buffered)." << endl;

    clog << "This is an error message using clog (buffered)." << endl;

    // Explicitly flushing clog to display its message immediately
    clog.flush();

/** 
Let me break it down with a simpler explanation and practical scenarios for **cerr** and **clog**.

---

### Why Use `cerr` and `clog`?

- **`cerr`**: Use this when you want **immediate feedback** about an error in your program. For example, if your program is processing user input and something goes wrong, you can use `cerr` to display an error message right away.

- **`clog`**: Use this when you want to **log errors efficiently** but don't need them displayed immediately. It's more efficient because it waits until a buffer is full or manually flushed to output the message.

---

### Real-Life Example

Suppose you're writing a program to process a file.

#### Code Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream file("data.txt");

    if (!file) {
        // Immediate error message
        cerr << "Error: Could not open the file 'data.txt'!" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Simulating file processing with a warning
    clog << "Warning: Processing might take longer for large files..." << endl;

    // File processing logic here
    cout << "File is being processed successfully." << endl;

    // Flush clog explicitly to display the buffered warning
    clog.flush();

    return 0;
}
```

---

### What Happens:
1. **When `file` cannot be opened:**
   - `cerr` immediately prints the error:  
     **"Error: Could not open the file 'data.txt'!"**  
     The program stops there.

2. **For `clog`:**
   - The warning is buffered and only shown when:
     - The buffer is full.
     - The program ends.
     - You explicitly call `flush()`.  
     Output: **"Warning: Processing might take longer for large files..."**

3. **For `cout`:**
   - Prints normal messages like: **"File is being processed successfully."**

---

### Why Use Buffered and Un-buffered Streams?

1. **When Immediate Output is Crucial (`cerr`):**
   Example: Displaying critical error messages that a user must act upon (like a missing file or invalid input).

2. **When Performance Matters (`clog`):**
   Example: Logging non-critical warnings during long-running processes. Buffering improves efficiency by reducing the number of times the program interacts with the output device (console or file).

---

### Practical Use Cases
- **`cerr`:**
  - Invalid user input.
  - Critical file read/write errors.

- **`clog`:**
  - Debugging logs during development.
  - Performance warnings that arenâ€™t critical for the user.
